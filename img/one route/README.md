# Extraction of one route along the network 
## 1st extraction
- fail to extract dst network -> unable to locate the destination? -> fail test
- For new extracted files: no core-0001 & core-0101; no aggr-0000, no aggr-1000, no aggr-2000, no aggr-3000

## 2nd extraction
- to test successfully 
  - add network subnet mask in dst file
  - change in the [coverage](../) to check if have the core in new extraction folder
- why still keep core-0100

## 3rd extraction
- coverage 82%
- without network subnet mask still work??

## 4th extraction
- converge
